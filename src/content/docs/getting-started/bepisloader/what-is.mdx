## Overview

BepisLoader is a specialized loader that allows BepInEx to work with Resonite. Since Resonite is not a standard Unity application and uses .NET 9, BepisLoader provides the necessary shims and patches to make everything work together.

## How It Works

BepisLoader acts as a bridge between BepInEx (a modding framework) and Resonite:

1. **hookfxr** intercepts Resonite's startup
2. **BepisLoader** loads instead, initializing BepInEx
3. **BepInEx** loads your mod plugins
4. **Resonite** starts normally with mods active

The system is transparent to Resonite - it doesn't know mods are running.

## Architecture

### Components

- **hostfxr.dll**: The entry point hook that intercepts .NET runtime loading
- **BepisLoader.dll**: Main loader that initializes BepInEx in the Resonite environment
- **BepInEx**: The modding framework that manages and loads plugins
- **Plugins**: Your mod code that extends Resonite functionality

### File Structure

After installation, your Resonite folder will contain:

```
Resonite/
├── BepInEx/
│   ├── config/           # Plugin configuration files
│   ├── plugins/          # Your mod plugins go here
│   ├── patchers/         # Preloader patches
│   └── LogOutput.log     # BepInEx log file
├── BepisLoader.dll       # Main loader
├── hostfxr.dll          # Entry point hook
├── hostfxr.pdb          # Debug symbols
└── hookfxr.ini          # Hook configuration
```

## Why BepisLoader?

### Compatibility

- Bridges the gap between BepInEx (designed for Unity games) and Resonite's custom .NET 9 architecture
- Provides necessary runtime patches for mod compatibility
- Handles assembly loading and dependency resolution

### Features

- **Non-invasive**: Doesn't modify Resonite's core files
- **Transparent**: Resonite runs normally without knowing mods exist
- **Flexible**: Supports the full BepInEx plugin ecosystem
- **Debuggable**: Includes logging and debugging capabilities

## Technical Details

### Loading Process

1. **Runtime Interception**: When Resonite starts, Windows loads `hostfxr.dll` instead of the normal .NET host
2. **Initialization**: BepisLoader initializes the BepInEx framework
3. **Plugin Discovery**: BepInEx scans the plugins folder for compatible mods
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Required assemblies and dependencies are loaded
5. **Patch Application**: Harmony patches are applied to Resonite methods
6. **Normal Startup**: Resonite continues its normal startup process with mods active

### Logs and Debugging

BepisLoader provides comprehensive logging:

- BepInEx logs: `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`
- Resonite logs: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Yellow Dog Man Studios\Resonite\`
