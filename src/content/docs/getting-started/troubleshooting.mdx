description: Solutions to common Resonite modding issues
---

This guide covers solutions to common problems when setting up and using Resonite mods.

## Common Issues

### Resonite Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Game crashes on launch or shows error dialogs

**Solutions**:
- Verify all BepisLoader files were extracted to the correct location (next to `Resonite.exe`)
- Check that `hostfxr.dll` exists in the Resonite folder
- Try running Steam as administrator
- Temporarily disable antivirus software and try again
- Verify game files through Steam (Properties → Local Files → Verify integrity)

### BepInEx Not Loading

**Symptoms**: No BepInEx console window, no `LogOutput.log` file created

**Solutions**:
- Install or repair the [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- Check if Windows Defender or antivirus has quarantined files
- Right-click downloaded files → Properties → Unblock if there's a security warning
- Look for errors in Windows Event Viewer under Application logs

### Mods Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Mods in `plugins` folder don't work in-game

**Checklist**:
- ✅ Mod files are `.dll` files in `BepInEx/plugins/`
- ✅ Mods target .NET 9.0 or compatible framework
- ✅ No error messages in `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`
- ✅ Mod dependencies are installed
- ✅ BepInEx is properly initialized

**Check the logs**:
```bash
# Look for mod loading messages
tail -f "BepInEx/LogOutput.log" | grep -i "plugin\|mod"
```

### Linux-Specific Issues

**Symptoms**: Game won't launch or BepInEx doesn't load on Linux

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `LinuxBootstrap.sh` has execute permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x LinuxBootstrap.sh
  ```
- Verify the bootstrap script points to `BepisLoader.dll`:
  ```bash
  grep -i "bepisloader" LinuxBootstrap.sh
  ```
- Check for missing .NET dependencies:
  ```bash
  ldd BepisLoader.dll
  ```
- Use forward slashes (`/`) not backslashes (`\`) in file paths

### Performance Problems

**Symptoms**: Game runs slowly, high CPU usage, or frequent stuttering

**Solutions**:
- Disable console logging in `BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg`:
  ```ini
  [Logging.Console]
  Enabled = false
  ```
- Remove unused mods from `plugins` folder
- Check mod compatibility - some mods may conflict
- Monitor system resources while playing
- Close other resource-intensive programs

### Mod Manager Issues

**Gale Problems**:
- Clear mod cache in Gale settings
- Verify Resonite installation path in Gale
- Check for Gale updates
- Try launching with administrator privileges

**r2modmanPlus Problems**:
- Refresh mod list in r2modman
- Clear r2modman cache folder
- Verify profile settings point to correct Resonite installation
- Check r2modman Discord for known issues

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Examining Log Files

**BepInEx Log Location**: `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`

**What to look for**:
- Initialization messages: `BepInEx [version] - Resonite`
- Plugin loading: `Loading [plugin name]`
- Error messages: `[Error]` or `[Fatal]`
- Assembly loading failures: `Could not load`

**Example healthy log**:
```
[Info   :   BepInEx] BepInEx 6.0.0.0 - Resonite
[Info   :   BepInEx] Running under .NET 9.0.0
[Info   :   BepInEx] BepisLoader initialized successfully
[Info   :BepInEx] Loading [MyMod 1.0.0]
[Info   :BepInEx] Loaded 1 plugin(s)
```

### Windows Event Logs

For system-level issues, check Windows Event Viewer:

1. Open Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`)
2. Navigate to Windows Logs → Application
3. Look for errors from `Resonite.exe` or `.NET Runtime`
4. Check the error details for specific failure reasons

### Process Monitoring

Use Process Monitor (ProcMon) to track file and registry access:

1. Download [ProcMon from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)
2. Set filter to Process Name is `Resonite.exe`
3. Launch Resonite and watch for access denied or file not found errors
4. Focus on operations involving BepisLoader files

### Network and Firewall Issues

If mods have network functionality:
- Check Windows Firewall exceptions for Resonite
- Verify router/antivirus isn't blocking connections
- Test with Windows Defender temporarily disabled
- Check if mod requires specific ports to be open

## Configuration Issues

### Wrong .NET Framework

**Error**: `The framework Microsoft.NETCore.App version 9.0.0 was not found`

**Solution**: Install [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)

### File Permissions

**Error**: Access denied or unable to write files

**Solutions**:
- Run Steam as administrator
- Check folder permissions on Resonite directory
- Ensure user has write access to BepInEx folders
- Disable "Controlled folder access" in Windows Security

### Path Issues

**Error**: Cannot find Resonite installation

**Check these locations**:
- Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite`
- Custom library: Steam → Settings → Downloads → Steam Library Folders
- Verify through Steam: Library → Right-click Resonite → Properties → Local Files

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting issues:

2. **Include system information**: OS, Resonite version, mod versions
3. **Attach log files**: Use pastebin or GitHub gists for long logs
4. **Describe steps to reproduce**: What exactly triggers the problem
5. **Mention workarounds**: If you found temporary fixes

## Clean Reinstall

If all else fails, completely remove and reinstall:

### Complete Removal

1. **Backup saves**: Copy your Resonite saves/worlds if needed
2. **Uninstall Resonite**: Through Steam or Windows Settings
3. **Delete leftover folders**: 
   - Resonite installation directory
   - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Yellow Dog Man Studios\Resonite`
4. **Clear registry**: Use Steam's built-in cleanup or tools like CCleaner

### Fresh Installation

1. **Reinstall Resonite**: Through Steam
2. **Test vanilla**: Launch once to ensure base game works
3. **Install mod manager**: Use method from installation guide
4. **Gradually add mods**: Install one mod at a time to identify conflicts

This systematic approach helps identify exactly what's causing issues.
