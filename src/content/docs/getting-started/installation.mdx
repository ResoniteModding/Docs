import { Card, CardGrid, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Get started with Resonite modding by installing a mod manager. BepisLoader will be installed automatically as a dependency when you install your first mod.

## Using a Mod Manager (Recommended)

Mod managers handle all the technical setup for you. They automatically install BepisLoader and manage your mods.

### Choose a Mod Manager

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Gale" icon="rocket">
		<p>Modern, lightweight mod manager with clean interface and automatic updates.</p>
		<LinkButton
			href="https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale?tab=readme-ov-file#installation"
			target={'_blank'}
			rel={'external'}
		>
			Install Gale
		</LinkButton>
	</Card>
	<Card title="r2modmanPlus" icon="setting">
		<p>Feature-rich mod manager with profile management and cross-platform support.</p>
		<LinkButton
			href="https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#installing"
			target={'_blank'}
			rel={'external'}
		>
			Install r2modmanPlus
		</LinkButton>
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Getting Started

1. **Launch** your mod manager
2. **Find Resonite** in the game list
3. **Browse mods** on Thunderstore
4. **Install mods** you want - BepisLoader installs automatically as a dependency
5. **Launch Resonite** through the mod manager

:::tip[Just Works]
The mod manager handles everything - BepisLoader installation, mod updates, and launch arguments. You don't need to manually install anything!

## Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

:::caution[Not Recommended]
Only use manual installation if you need custom configurations or are developing mods. Most users should use mod managers above.
:::

If you need manual control:

1. **Download** [BepisLoader-full.zip](https://github.com/art0007i/BepisLoader/releases/latest)
2. **Extract** directly into your Resonite folder (next to `Resonite.exe`)
3. **(Linux only)** Edit `LinuxBootstrap.sh` to launch `BepisLoader.dll`
4. **Launch Resonite** - you should see BepInEx messages

**File locations:**

- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Resonite`

## Verification

After installation, check that:

- ‚úÖ BepInEx folder appears in your Resonite directory
- ‚úÖ No error messages when launching Resonite
- ‚úÖ Mods load correctly in-game
