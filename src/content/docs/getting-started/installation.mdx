import { Card, CardGrid, LinkButton } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Get started with Resonite modding by installing a mod manager. BepisLoader will be installed automatically as a dependency when you install your first mod.

## Using a Mod Manager (Recommended)

Mod managers handle all the technical setup for you. They automatically install BepisLoader and manage your mods.

### Choose a Mod Manager

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Gale" icon="rocket">
    <p>Modern, lightweight mod manager with clean interface and automatic updates.</p>
    <LinkButton
      href="https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale?tab=readme-ov-file#installation"
      target={'_blank'}
      rel={'external'}
    >
      Install Gale
    </LinkButton>
  </Card>
  <Card title="r2modmanPlus" icon="setting">
    <p>Feature-rich mod manager with profile management and cross-platform support.</p>
    <LinkButton
      href="https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#installing"
      target={'_blank'}
      rel={'external'}
    >
      Install r2modmanPlus
    </LinkButton>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Getting Started

1. **Launch** your mod manager
2. **Find Resonite** in the game list
3. **Browse mods** on Thunderstore
4. **Install mods** you want - BepisLoader installs automatically as a dependency
5. **Launch Resonite** through the mod manager

:::tip[Just Works]
The mod manager handles everything - BepisLoader installation, mod updates. You don't need to manually install anything!

## Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

:::caution[Not Recommended]
Only use manual installation if you need custom configurations or are developing mods. Most users should use mod managers above.
:::

If you need manual control:

1. **Download** [BepisLoader-full.zip](https://github.com/art0007i/BepisLoader/releases/latest)
2. **Extract** directly into your Resonite folder (next to `Resonite.exe`)
3. **Launch Resonite** - you should see BepInEx logs in the console

**File locations:** (it may vary based on your Steam library location)

- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Resonite`

## Next Steps

Now that you have a mod manager installed:

- [Create your first mod](/getting-started/first-mod/) to start coding
- [Browse mods on Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/resonite/) to find existing mods
