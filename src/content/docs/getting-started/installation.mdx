Get started with Resonite modding by installing a mod loader. **BepisLoader** is the recommended and most widely supported option - it will be installed automatically when you use a mod manager.

## Using a Mod Manager (Recommended)

Mod managers handle all the technical setup for you. They automatically install BepisLoader and manage your mods.

### Choose a Mod Manager

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Gale" icon="rocket">
    <p>Modern, lightweight mod manager with clean interface and automatic updates.</p>
    <LinkButton
      href="https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale?tab=readme-ov-file#installation"
      target={'_blank'}
      rel={'external'}
    >
      Install Gale
    </LinkButton>
  </Card>
  <Card title="r2modmanPlus" icon="setting">
    <p>Feature-rich mod manager with profile management and cross-platform support.</p>
    <LinkButton
      href="https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#installing"
      target={'_blank'}
      rel={'external'}
    >
      Install r2modmanPlus
    </LinkButton>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Getting Started

1. **Launch** your mod manager
2. **Find Resonite** in the game list
3. **Browse mods** on Thunderstore
4. **Install mods** you want - BepisLoader installs automatically as a dependency
5. **Launch Resonite** through the mod manager

:::tip[Just Works]
The mod manager handles everything - BepisLoader installation, mod updates. You don't need to manually install anything!

## Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

:::caution[Not Recommended]
Only use manual installation if you need custom configurations or are developing mods. Most users should use mod managers above.
:::

If you need manual control:

1. **Download** BepisLoader from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/resonite/p/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader/) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader/releases/latest)
2. **Extract** the ZIP file
3. **Copy** the contents of the `BepInExPack` folder to your Resonite installation root directory
4. **Launch Resonite** - BepInEx will generate configuration files on first run

**Find your Resonite folder:**
- Via Steam: `Steam > Library > Resonite > Manage > Browse local files`
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite`
- **Linux**: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Resonite`

## Alternative Mod Loaders

While BepisLoader is the recommended option (and the only one supported on Thunderstore), there are other mod loaders available for Resonite:

:::tip[Why BepisLoader?]
BepisLoader is recommended for new users because:
- **Thunderstore integration** - Access to a massive, established mod repository
- **Mod manager support** - Easy installation and updates with r2modman/Gale
- **BepInEx foundation** - Built on proven technology used across many games
- **Works alongside RML** - Can use both BepisLoader and RML mods together

Note: BepisLoader and ResoniteModLoader can be used side-by-side! This gives you access to both Thunderstore mods (via BepisLoader) and the existing RML mod ecosystem. Only BepisLoader mods are managed through Thunderstore mod managers.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a mod loader installed:

- [Use mods](/getting-started/using-mods/) from the community
- [Create your first mod](/creating-a-mod/initial-setup/) to start developing
- [Browse mods on Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/resonite/) to find existing mods
