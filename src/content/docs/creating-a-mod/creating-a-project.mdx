Creating a mod for Resonite is simple using the official BepInEx template. This guide covers installing the template, generating a project, and configuring it for development.

## Installing

.NET templates must be installed before they can be used. This means that when you install the template, it doesn't create a new project for you, but you will get the ability to do that.

Once you have the template installed, you don't need to install it again, through it's a good idea to update it if there are updates.

:::caution
You must use .NET SDK 9 or newer. Older versions are unsupported.
:::

### From NuGet (Recommended)

Install the template from the Resonite modding NuGet feed:

```bash
dotnet new install BepInEx.Templates::2.0.0-be.* --nuget-source https://nuget-modding.resonite.net/v3/index.json
```

### Manual Install

If you're contributing to the template or prefer manual installation:

1. Clone or download [this repository](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepInEx.Templates)
2. Navigate to the `BepInEx.Templates` folder
3. Run:

```bash
cd BepInEx.Templates
dotnet new install .
```

To update:

```bash
git pull
dotnet new install . --force
```

To uninstall:

```bash
dotnet new uninstall .
```

Once installed, the template will be available as `BepInEx 6 Resonite Plugin` with the short name `bep6resonite`.

## Creating a New Mod

Run the following command in your Resonite modding directory:

:::note
By default, the first value in `--authors` is used as your Thunderstore team name. If this doesn't match your actual Thunderstore team, you'll need to manually update the `namespace` field in `thunderstore.toml`.

A Thunderstore "team" is simply the author name your mods are published under - it can be just your username.

Create your Thunderstore team here: https://thunderstore.io/settings/teams/create/
:::

```bash
dotnet new bep6resonite --name MyPluginName --authors "MyName" --packageId net.myname.mypluginmame --repositoryUrl "https://github.com/myuser/mymod"
```

This will create a new folder called `MyPluginName` with your mod's project.

### Template Options

You can customize your project with these options:

- `-ve|--version` - Plugin version (default: 1.0.0)
- `-au|--authors` - Comma-separated list of plugin authors (default: YourName)
- `-r|--repositoryUrl` - Repository URL (auto-generated as `https://github.com/[FirstAuthor]/[ProjectName]` if empty)
- `-p|--packageId` - Package ID (auto-generated as `[FirstAuthor].[ProjectName]` if empty)
- `-g|--gitInit` - Initialize a git repository (default: true)

:::tip
Use `dotnet new bep6resonite --help` to see all available options.

## Project Structure

This example demonstrates creating a project with the template:

```bash
~/Workspace/Resonite$ dotnet new bep6resonite -n ResoniteMod
The template "BepInEx 6 Resonite Plugin (.NET 9, Thunderstore Ready)" was created successfully.
```

After creation, you'll see helpful next steps instructions. Now let's look at the project structure:

```bash
~/Workspace/Resonite$ cd ResoniteMod/
```

The file structure in `ResoniteMod/` should look like this:

<FileTree>
- .gitignore
- CHANGELOG.md
- Directory.Build.targets
- icon.png
- LICENSE
- README.md
- ResoniteMod.sln
- thunderstore.toml
- .config/
  - dotnet-tools.json
- ResoniteMod/
  - Plugin.cs
  - ResoniteMod.csproj
  - Properties/
    - launchSettings.json
</FileTree>

Key points:

- Your mod code is in `./<project-name>/`
- `Directory.Build.targets` file defines `PackTS` target, see the [Packaging and Publishing](/creating-a-mod/packaging-and-publishing) guide
- `<project-name>.sln` is your project solution

The project is configured so that it's easy to add new projects into your project solution. Even if you don't need that, it's good to follow this standard project structure.

### Post-Creation Setup

After creating your project, the template provides helpful instructions:

1. **Set up game path**: Either set `ResonitePath` environment variable or update `GamePath` in the .csproj
2. **Review metadata**: Update project metadata in the .csproj file (Version, Authors, etc.)
3. **Replace TODOs**: Search for `TODO` comments in the generated template and replace them with your actual values
4. **Build**: Run `dotnet build` - this automatically copies the plugin to BepInEx/plugins folder

### Automatic Game Path Detection

The template automatically finds your Resonite installation:

1. First checks the `ResonitePath` environment variable
2. Falls back to Steam installation paths
3. Uses NuGet package for game references if local install not found

### Build Configuration

Your plugin metadata is automatically generated from `.csproj` properties:

- `PackageID` → Plugin GUID
- `Product` → Plugin Name
- `Version` → Plugin Version
- `Authors` → Plugin Authors
- `RepositoryUrl` → Repository URL

### Thunderstore Packaging

The template includes built-in Thunderstore packaging support. Your project comes with:

- `thunderstore.toml` - Package configuration
- `icon.png` - Your mod's icon (replace with your own 256x256 image)
- Build targets for creating and publishing packages

For detailed packaging and publishing instructions, see the [Packaging and Publishing](/creating-a-mod/packaging-and-publishing) guide.
