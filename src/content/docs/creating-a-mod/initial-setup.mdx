Modding might sound complicated, but it's much easier if you start with the right mindset and a simple mod.

## Install the Requirements

Before you can start modding Resonite, you'll need to install two essential tools:

- **.NET SDK 9.0** – _This is needed so you can compile C# code._
  - [Download .NET here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- **IDE** – _This is where you'll write and build your code. Choosing one can depend on your preferences and system._
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (A lightweight, fast, and highly customizable editor with a wide range of extensions.)
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (A powerful, feature-rich IDE widely used for C# and .NET development.)
  - [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/#) (A full-featured, IDE optimized for C# and .NET development.)

Now that you have .NET and an IDE, we can move on to creating your first mod.

:::caution
This guide will not cover setting up your IDE. If you're stuck at this point, try watching a video tutorial.

## Installing BepInEx

You'll need BepInEx (via BepisLoader) installed to develop mods. Follow our [installation guide](/getting-started/installation/) to set it up using either:

- **Mod Manager** (recommended) - Easy automatic installation
- **Manual installation** - For custom configurations

:::note[Console Window]
If you've used BepInEx before, you may notice the console window doesn't appear — this is disabled by default in BepisLoader.

You can enable the console by opening `BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` and in the `[Logging.Console]` section, setting `Enabled = true`, mod managers also let you easily access config options and edit them.

## Installing a Decompiler

:::note
This step is optional but highly recommended if you want to understand or debug Resonite's code.
:::

A decompiler allows you to inspect the game’s internal code. This helps you discover useful classes and methods that can be modified using Harmony.

You only need one decompiler. Recommended options:

- [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) (best decompilation)
  - [ILSpyCmd](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/tree/master/ICSharpCode.ILSpyCmd) (CLI option)
  - [ilspy-vscode](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ilspy-vscode) (Visual Studio Code extension)
- [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy)
- [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/#)

:::caution
Many of these options are not natively supported on Linux. [ILSpyCmd](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/tree/master/ICSharpCode.ILSpyCmd) is recommended in this case as it can output a full C# project which can be viewed in any IDE, which for pure C# viewing can be a better experience than any other option. If you are using Visual Studio Code, [ilspy-vscode](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ilspy-vscode) can be used for viewing IL, although a standalone app would be better for this.

An [ILSpy Avalonia frontend](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvaloniaILSpy) also exists that supports Linux, however it doesn't seem to be maintained as of writing and is buggy.
