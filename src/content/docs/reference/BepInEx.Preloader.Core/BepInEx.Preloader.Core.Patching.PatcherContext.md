## Definition

Context provided to patcher plugins from the associated patcher engine.

```csharp title="C#"
public class PatcherContext
```

Inheritance [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object/)

## Properties

### AvailableAssemblies

<p>Contains a list of assemblies that will be patched and loaded into the runtime.</p> <p>     The dictionary has the name of the file, without any directories. These are used by the dumping     functionality, and as such, these are also required to be unique. They do not have to be exactly the same as     the real filename, however they have to be mapped deterministically. </p> <p>Order is not respected, as it will be sorted by dependencies.</p>

```csharp title="C#"
public Dictionary<string, AssemblyDefinition> AvailableAssemblies { get; }
```

### AvailableAssembliesPaths

<p>Contains a mapping of available assembly name to their original filenames.</p>

```csharp title="C#"
public Dictionary<string, string> AvailableAssembliesPaths { get; }
```

### LoadedAssemblies

<p>Contains a dictionary of assemblies that have been loaded as part of executing this assembly patcher.</p> <p>     The key is the same key as used in [LoadedAssemblies](../bepinex.preloader.core.patching.patchercontext.loadedassemblies/#loadedassemblies/), while the value is the actual assembly     itself. </p>

```csharp title="C#"
public Dictionary<string, Assembly> LoadedAssemblies { get; }
```

### PatcherPlugins

A list of plugins that will be initialized and executed, in the order of the list.

```csharp title="C#"
public List<BasePatcher> PatcherPlugins { get; }
```

### PatchDefinitions

A list of individual patches that [AssemblyPatcher](../bepinex.preloader.core.patching.assemblypatcher/) will execute, generated by parsing [PatcherPlugins](../bepinex.preloader.core.patching.patchercontext.patcherplugins/#patcherplugins/).

```csharp title="C#"
public List<PatchDefinition> PatchDefinitions { get; }
```

### DumpedAssembliesPath

```csharp title="C#"
public string DumpedAssembliesPath { get; }
```
